## M0 — Spike *(1–2 days)* `[x]`

**Goal:** Pick stack, render a grid, place one building.

**Open decisions (blockers)**

- [x] Framework: React + Vite + TypeScript (decided 2026-05-29)
- [x] Canvas renderer: Konva via react-konva (decided 2026-05-29)
- [x] Canonical building data source — `resources/presets.json` (community layout tool dataset, v5.1, 2026-05-30)
- [ ] Three-pane wireframe sketch

**Tasks**

- [x] Scaffold Vite project with chosen framework
- [x] Render a tile grid on screen
- [x] Place one hardcoded building on the grid
- [x] Record stack decision in `docs/`

**Human gate:** Kaleb + Ian evaluate feel, pick stack, update CLAUDE.md.

---

## M1 — Core Canvas *(4–6 days)* `[x]`

**Goal:** Fully interactive canvas with persistence.

**Tasks**

- [x] Pan and zoom (mouse wheel zoom-to-pointer + space/middle-drag pan)
- [x] Place building (click from palette)
- [x] Rotate building (R key)
- [x] Delete building (Del key)
- [x] Multi-select (shift-click + drag box-select)
- [x] Snap-to-grid
- [x] Undo / redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) via Immer history
- [x] IndexedDB persistence (auto-save on change)
- [x] Basic keyboard shortcut set (R, Del, Esc, Ctrl+Z/Y)

**Human gate:** Kaleb reviews canvas feel and snap accuracy before merge to `dev`.

---

## M2 — Building Catalog *(3–5 days)* `[x]` *(completed 2026-05-30)*

**Goal:** Full Old World building set with palette and overlays.

**Tasks**

- [x] Finalize building JSON schema (`src/types/domain.ts` — added `iconFile`, `workRadius`, `overlayType`, `group`)
- [x] Ingest Old World buildings — 156 buildings (farmers → investors + harbor + all-worlds) extracted from `resources/presets.json` into `src/data/buildings-1800.json`
- [x] Categorized, searchable building palette — tier filter tabs + live search + grouped by category
- [x] DLC badges on buildings (Seat of Power, Docklands, Empire of the Skies, Seeds of Change)
- [x] Influence overlay system — `src/state/overlayStore.ts`; 13 service buildings with overlay types (market, pub, church, fire, police, education, health, bank, culture, power)
- [x] Overlay toggle bar at top of canvas — `src/components/OverlayBar.tsx`

**Human gate:** Ian spot-checks 10% of building stats against the Anno 1800 wiki; Kaleb reviews palette UX.

---

## M3 — Math, Library & Export *(3–5 days)* `[x]` *(completed 2026-05-30)*

**Goal:** Production math, blueprint library, and sharing.

**Tasks**

- [x] Production math engine — `src/lib/productionMath.ts`; 32 buildings, 47 goods; 13 Vitest tests (Furnace ratio validated)
- [x] Live t/min tallies in Inspector — green surplus / red deficit, memoized on placements
- [x] Blueprint library — save/load/rename/duplicate/delete; `BlueprintLibrary.tsx` modal; Dexie 'current' + UUID slots
- [x] JSON export / import — validates buildingIds, skips unknowns
- [x] PNG export — `stage.toDataURL({ pixelRatio: 2 })` via Konva stage ref
- [x] Compressed URL share — LZ-string → `#bp=` fragment; clipboard copy + toast; decoded on mount
- [x] File System Access API — `showSaveFilePicker`/`showOpenFilePicker` with blob/input fallback

**Human gate:** Ian verifies math ratios against known Anno 1800 values before merge.

---

## M4 — PWA Polish *(2–3 days)* `[x]` *(completed 2026-05-30)*

**Goal:** Offline-capable, installable, polished.

**Tasks**

- [x] Workbox service worker — `vite-plugin-pwa` with `autoUpdate`, caches all static assets
- [x] Installable PWA manifest — name, icons (SVG 192+512), `display: standalone`, theme `#0a0a16`
- [x] Anno-themed palette — CSS custom properties (`--accent: #c8a96e`, `--accent-dim`, etc.) replacing all blue/purple tones
- [x] First-run onboarding — `Onboarding.tsx` modal (localStorage flag); "Load tutorial layout" pre-places a Farmers production chain
- [x] Minimap — `Minimap.tsx` plain-canvas overlay (160×100) in canvas bottom-right; shows placements + viewport rect
- [x] Sprite pass — category accent band, shadow on labels, Anno gold selection highlight; `/public/icons/` ready for real sprites

**Human gate:** Kaleb reviews visual polish and sprite quality; both test offline install flow.

---

## M5 — Personal Release *(0.5–1 day)* `[x]` *(completed 2026-06-01)*

**Goal:** Ship to static host, self-dogfood.

**Tasks**

- [x] Production build (`vite build`)
- [x] Deploy to Netlify — `netlify.toml`; auto-deploy on push to `main`
- [x] Smoke-test all golden paths
- [x] Personal release marked complete; `.claude/` guarded from git

---

## M6 — Engine & Hardening `[~]` *(started 2026-06-02)*

**Goal:** Workforce calculation, data gaps, building consolidation, resizable panes, and full test coverage.

**Scope:** Workforce (#1), Missing outputs — Red Pepper / Cattle (#2), Flour Mill grain display (#3), Building consolidation (#4), Unit testing (#5), Resizable panes (#6).

### Phase 0 — Test & data foundation `[x]` *(commit 5480719)*

- [x] Add `@vitest/coverage-v8`; wire `test:run` and `test:coverage` scripts; set coverage gate for `src/lib/**`
- [x] Add `jsdom` + `@testing-library/react` for component tests; split Vitest config (node vs jsdom environments)
- [x] Data-integrity test suite — no duplicate ids, every chain mapping resolves, every good and input/output exists
- [x] CI wired: `tsc -b` → `test:run` → `build`

### Phase 1 — Generalize the engine `[x]` *(commit 5480719)*

- [x] Introduce `ResourceFlow` / `buildingFlows` / `aggregateFlows` — unified signed flow model (`good:` and `workforce:` namespaced ids)
- [x] `goodsTallies` and `workforceTotals` convenience selectors
- [x] Re-express `computeTallies` on top of `aggregateFlows`; public API backward-compatible
- [x] `productionMath.ts` at 100% line/branch coverage

### Phase 2 — Fill data gaps `[x]` *(commit 5480719)*

Fixes #2 (Red Pepper / Cattle) and #3 (Flour Mill grain display).

- [x] Add chain rows + id-based mappings for Red Pepper Farm and Cattle Farm (New World tier, Artisans)
- [x] Inspector updated to show produced / consumed / net per good — Flour Mill grain consumption now visible even when net-balanced
- [x] Data-driven tests: pepper output, cattle output, flour-mill grain consumption, mixed blueprint

### Phase 3 — Workforce `[x]` *(commit 6802272)*

Fixes #1 (workforce calculation).

- [x] `WorkforceRequirement[]` schema added to `ChainBuilding` in `productionChain.ts`
- [x] `buildingFlows` emits workforce flows as negative demand; `aggregateFlows` totals by tier
- [x] All 35 production buildings populated with workforce data in `production-chains.json`
- [x] Inspector Workforce panel — required headcount per tier, only shown when `consumed > 0`
- [x] Data-integrity test covers workforce tier validity and positive counts
- [x] 37 tests passing; `productionMath.ts` stays at 100% coverage

**Human gate:** Workforce numbers for artisans/engineers buildings (marked `verify: true` in `production-chains.json`) should be cross-checked against the Anno 1800 wiki before Phase 4 ships.

### Phase 4 — Building consolidation `[x]` *(commit 668855a)*

Fixes #4 (duplicate-id bug; Small Warehouse tier variants now have unique ids).

- [x] Assign unique ids to all 5 Small Warehouse tier entries in `buildings-1800.json`; add tier labels to names
- [x] `LEGACY_ID_MAP` + `migratePlacements()` in `src/lib/migration.ts` — pure, idempotent, drops nothing
- [x] Migration wired at all three load paths: Dexie v1→v2 upgrade, `importJSON`, `decodeShareURL`
- [x] Duplicate-id integrity test un-skipped and passing
- [x] 9 migration tests; `migration.ts` at 100% coverage; 47 total tests green

### Phase 5 — Resizable panes `[ ]`

Fixes #6 (hard-coded 3-column grid in `App.css`).

- [ ] State-driven CSS grid widths with draggable gutters; min/max constraints + proportional auto-adjust on window resize
- [ ] `localStorage` persistence for `{left, right}` column widths with viewport clamping on restore
- [ ] Konva stage re-measures on pane resize via `ResizeObserver` — canvas never clips
- [ ] Unit tests for `redistribute()` math; Playwright drag/persist/reset E2E

### Phase 6 — Hardening `[ ]`

- [ ] Playwright E2E: place → compute → save → reload → migrate golden path
- [ ] Enforce coverage gate in CI; PWA cache bump for data changes
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / docs to reflect M6 completion

## Phase 2 (post-MVP, not in scope)

- Optimizer mode
- Diff view (compare two blueprints)
- Collaborative editing (WebRTC / Yjs CRDT)
- Mod support (community building packs via JSON manifest)
- Island templates
- Timeline mode (plan build order across eras)
